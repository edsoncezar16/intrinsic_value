# Intrinsic

A data app to support value investing decisions in the Braziian Stock Exchange.

## Methodology

Computes the **earnings power of a company**, defined as the **average earnings over the last 10 years divided by its current price**, and recommends buying when there is a **margin of safety** of at least 50% as compared to the yield on long-term government bond, and selling when the above margin of safety is negative.

For a deep dive on the above concepts, we recommend the reading of [The Intelligent Investor](https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661) (especially Chapter 20).
